HOW TO INSTALL THE CORGI ENGINE?
-----------------------------------

The engine relies on a few Unity packages to work, these are not installed by default by Unity, and will cause errors on install, that's completely normal.

To install the Corgi Engine, please follow these steps :

1. Create a new project from Unity Hub, pick Unity 2019.2 as your Unity version, and 3D as the Template
2. Go to the Asset Store window and import the project (it has to be in an empty project, not an existing one)
3. On import you'll get errors referencing Cinemachine and PostProcessing, that's normal, don't panic :)
4. At the root of the Corgi Engine folder in your Project window, there's a file called "manifest". 
You'll want to copy it into your project's Packages folder (at the "top" of your level, same level as Assets, Library, etc), replacing the one that is already there.

And that's all there is to it!
Have fun with the engine!

You can learn more about the install process at https://corgi-engine-docs.moremountains.com/how-to-install.html

PS : If you're not on a version of Unity yet supported by the Corgi Engine, you can install the missing packages manually, via the Package Manager. You'll want Cinemachine, PostProcessing and Pixel Perfect.
